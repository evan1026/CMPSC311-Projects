File Descriptions
src/main.c - Handles inputs, opens and closes the files, creates child processes, reads from the files and adds each word to the hashtable and linked list, outputs to files
src/hashtable.* - A hashtable created in order to speed up our program. It allows for constant lookup of words and counts
src/list.* - The linked list to keep track of which words have been found, used in conjunction with the hashtable
src/elapsedtime.* - Handles measuring the time taken to complete running the program


Experience
One problem we ran into initially was trying to share the file pointer between processes be cause at the time an email hadn't been sent out about the issue. Having each child open up the file seperately solved this issue however. Another issue we ran into was the loop we initially were using to read until the end of the file relied on feof, but that would sometimes cause the children to reach EOF before they had finished their portion. We ended up using a more complex loop condition (line 129 in main.c) to fix this issue and make sure we were covering the entire file. Another problem was splitting up the file properly and making sure there was no overlap although this wasn't major, it was just tricky making sure that they were all about even and didn't read any of the same words twice or miss any. And one of the final problems we faced was getting the program to work correctly when there were more processes than bytes in the file but in that case we made it so that the parent just reads the entire file and the children do nothing.

Design Choices
One interesting choice we made (in project 1 but it still applies) is that we used a hashtable in addition to the linked list so that we would have constant time for lookup of words and their counts which made our program much faster than it originally was with the linked list.
